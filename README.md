Thank you for downloading the Twitter AdBlock Beta. Currently it has only been tested on Chrome and Brave but it should work on any Chrome based web browser. Right now it's not available for any other browser, but I don't imagine it's too difficult to make up sme different versions.

Installation instructions

	Go to chrome://extensions and switch on "Developer mode" - on Brave this can be found at the top right corner of the extensions page, under the purple header bar.

	Click "Load unpacked"

	Select the TwitterAdBlock directory (the unzipped directory) and click OK or Open.

	Flick the switch to the on position (circle of switch facing right)

	That's it, it will automatically be in use.

This extension does not in any way relay any information back to me. It can't post on your timeline, it merely changes the DOM to remove adverts from your sight. If you click on a link which Twitter has deemed to be unsafe merely because they disagree with the content, that page is automatically loaded to the link you requested originally.

Feel free to look at and modify the code. It's completely open source and free to use in every way. If there are any errors or changes you want to submit, you can contact me on Github or you can email me at tony@gamebud.online or you can submit changes using Github.

Keep a look out for updates, being new there are bound to be things I've missed.

A quick advert:

GameBud online is a free to use online HTML5 games station. I'm currently working on a downloadable version which will allow you to play games & follow devs - the aim for that is for it to be an open source, decentralised platform where game devs can publish & monetise their work while gamers can follow them, communicate with one another and play games through an app on their device. It's in Beta and there's a lot of work to be done, but feel free to take a look and pass on any ideas you may have.

Kind Regards

Tony
